This is what I have gotten done so far. I am made sure to give the game window it's name and have everything I will need defined before I start the game loop and dive into that. I also learned first about the arrow key controls first which was the trickiest thing.
I used the pygame website that was shown to us for most of my referencing. I will soon be learning to code the snake's length and growth, which also comes with coding the food into the game as well.
I choose to do the snake game because that was the game I felt I would feel the most enjoyment during the process throughout this project. 
I will make sure I am very well educated and prepared when it comes the day I must present and run my Snake Game.
