<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In today’s technological days, social media apps such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc. have become an integral part of an average person’s daily life. Interaction between people has evolved so much that you can watch or listen to anyone in any part of the world. Within all these social media apps are influencers, also known as public figures, and these public figures have a community of supporters that enjoy sitting down and hearing what such a person has to say. With that much connection comes the effect it plays on the people that are watching and the community who receives the information being displayed. So come with me as I give you the main idea of the effects social media and public influencers give our society. </p>
