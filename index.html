<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In today’s technological days, social media apps such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc. have become an integral part of an average person’s daily life. Interaction between people has evolved so much that you can watch or listen to anyone in any part of the world. Within all these social media apps are influencers, also known as public figures, and these public figures have a community of supporters that enjoy sitting down and hearing what such a person has to say. With that much connection comes the effect it plays on the people that are watching and the community who receives the information being displayed. So come with me as I give you the main idea of the effects social media and public influencers give our society. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
  <p>Before giving the rundown on how social media and public figures have on our society, we should go over how social media came to be. Social media dates back to 1997, where the first form of social media connection was from the “father of social networking”, Andrew Weinreich’s launch of SixDegrees. It was considered the facebook ahead of its time because it served as a networking platform, helping connect people via email links who shared similar interests with one another. It was a brilliant idea, but unfortunately due to the insufficient technology to manage and facilitate such an application, Andrew Weinreich decided it was best to sell SixDegrees. He sold SixDegrees for approximately $125 million in 1999 and ventured into a different path. Little did he know that social media would sky rocket in the new millennium. </p>
<h3>The Explosion</h3>  
  <p>Social media would take off and become worldwide with apps such as LinkedIn, MySpace, and YouTube would change the landscape of modern day entertainment. It wouldn’t stay stagnant as well and it would only keep developing and evolving as time went on, with more and more apps being made every year. Although some would stay and some would go, the main ones as stated in the intro would never leave. Now there were always many forms of entertainment such as movies, tv, music, sports etc. before social media. Now people can see their favorite actor, sports star, musician in a whole different light and feel more connected towards them. With that connection, you can guess that of course there is some influence played. </p>
<h4>The Influence</h4>
  <p>Now in our modern day world, people have deep connections with many public figures due to the likeness of one's personality, what entertainment they provide, and many other things. With this comes the effect these public figures give to the audience and its fan base. Many public figures use the opportunity to connect with their fanbase, and push their ideology towards their community of supporters. Although the ideas may be controversial ones, it still gives a major effect towards the community and sways their viewpoints on such topics. Many people in our society are truly attached to an actor, musician, star ect, that they will follow many of their ideas just to be a supporter. Now comes social media, where is the way these public figures connect to society. We saw it back in our most recent election, where President Trump would use Twitter, TikTok, and go on content creators streams to connect to a certain demographic of society. Some could say it worked as he is now our President.

<h5>Effects Social Media Plays Include:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Mental Health</li>
    <li>Creativity</li>
    <li>Beliefs</li>
    <li>Education</li>
    <li>Bussiness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are many benefits but also many negative impacts social media can play on our society. It can be uplifting as you can receive waves of support for a journey you are taking and decide to share online. You are also exploiting yourself to detrimental things such as cyberbullying, doxxing, and much more. Social media is not always going to be an easy place and can be very challenging to withstand. In many other instances however, social media can be the best thing that happens to you where you can be connected to many just like yourself, or YOU could also become the one to provide that joy to others, filling yourself with gratification and proudness. </p>

<h6>Conclusion</h6>  
  <p>Social Media plays a major impact on our society, and the public figures within it as well. To many social media is a place where they find comfort and connect wiht others with beliefs just like theirs. Some are looking to find someting to believe in, or follow the footsteps of their favorite public figure and trying to be just like them. Others can be caught in the crossfire and deal with many negative parts of social media. The effetcs that social media plays will seem to never change unless the people within change themselves. Now as we go foward om pur technological discoveries, we must continue to do our best to make sure social media is a better place to surround others because you want to be a good effect on other people just like them to you. </p>
