<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In today’s technological days, social media apps such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc. have become an integral part of an average person’s daily life. Interaction between people has evolved so much that you can watch or listen to anyone in any part of the world. Within all these social media apps are influencers, also known as public figures, and these public figures have a community of supporters that enjoy sitting down and hearing what such a person has to say. With that much connection comes the effect it plays on the people that are watching and the community who receives the information being displayed. So come with me as I give you the main idea of the effects social media and public influencers give our society. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
  <p>Before giving the rundown on how social media and public figures have on our society, we should go over how social media came to be. Social media dates back to 1997, where the first form of social media connection was from the “father of social networking”, Andrew Weinreich’s launch of SixDegrees. It was considered the facebook ahead of its time because it served as a networking platform, helping connect people via email links who shared similar interests with one another. It was a brilliant idea, but unfortunately due to the insufficient technology to manage and facilitate such an application, Andrew Weinreich decided it was best to sell SixDegrees. He sold SixDegrees for approximately $125 million in 1999 and ventured into a different path. Little did he know that social media would sky rocket in the new millennium. </p>
